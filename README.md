# Contiki-cc26xx-SerialInput
Example of getting serial input from the cc26xx. Code was tested using the TI Launchpad CC2650.

Run build.sh to build code. Upload either the .elf or .hex file to the Launchpad CC2650. To interact with the Launchpad CC2650 in serial mode set baudrate to 115200 and ensure Newline is inserted at the end of each input.
